### Working Papers

<br/>

[Asymmetric Network Connectedness of Fears](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pba685.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Bevilacqua, and R.Tunaru)<br/>
Submitted (2019)<br/>

**Abstract**: We study how shocks to the forward-looking expectations of future stock prices, extracted from call and put options, create asymmetric network connections. We introduce a new measure of network connectedness, called asymmetric fear connectedness, which captures the information related to fear on both sides of the options market, and that can be a useful forward-looking systemic risk monitoring tool. The decomposed connectedness measures provide timely predictive information for near-future macroeconomic and uncertainty indicators, and they contain additional valuable information not included in the aggregate network connectedness measure.

[Tail Risks, Asset prices, and Investment Horizons](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1806.06148.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Nevrla)<br/>
Submitted (2019)<br/>

**Abstract**: We examine how extreme market risks are priced in the cross-section of asset returns at various horizons. Based on the frequency decomposition of covariance between indicator functions, we define the quantile cross-spectral beta of an asset capturing tail-specific as well as horizon-, or frequency-specific risks. Further, we work with two notions of frequency-specific extreme market risks. First, we define tail market risk that captures dependence between extremely low market as well as asset returns. Second, extreme market volatility risk is characterized by dependence between extremely high increments of market volatility and extremely low asset return. Empirical findings based on the datasets with long enough history, 30 Fama-French Industry portfolios, and 25 Fama-French portfolios sorted on size and book-to-market support our intuition. Results suggest that both frequency-specific tail market risk and extreme volatility risks are significantly priced and our five-factor model provides improvement over specifications considered by previous literature.

[Measurement of Common Risk Factors: A Panel Quantile Regression Model for Returns](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1708.08622.html){:target="blank"} (with F.Cech)<br/>
Submitted (2019)<br/>

**Abstract**: This paper investigates how to measure common market risk factors using newly proposed Panel Quantile Regression Model for Returns. By exploring the fact that volatility crosses all quantiles of the return distribution and using penalized fixed effects estimator we are able to control for otherwise unobserved heterogeneity among financial assets. Direct benefits of the proposed approach are revealed in the portfolio Value-at-Risk forecasting application, where our modeling strategy performs significantly better than several benchmark models according to both statistical and economic comparison. In particular Panel Quantile Regression Model for Returns consistently outperforms all the competitors in the 5% and 10% quantiles. Sound statistical performance translates directly into economic gains which is demonstrated in the Global Minimum Value-at-Risk Portfolio and Markowitz-like comparison. Overall results of our research are important for correct identification of the sources of systemic risk, and are particularly attractive for high dimensional applications.
