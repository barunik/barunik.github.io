[The Dynamic Persistence of Economic Shocks](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4467110){:target="blank"} (with L.Vacha)<br/>
preprint draft (June 2023)<br/>

**Abstract**: This paper presents a model for smoothly varying heterogeneous persistence of economic data. We argue that such dynamics arise naturally from the dynamic nature of economic shocks with various degree of persistence. The identification of such dynamics from data is done using localised regressions. Empirically, we identify rich persistence structures that change smoothly over time in two important data sets: inflation, which plays a key role in policy formulation, and stock volatility, which is crucial for risk and market analysis.  <br/>

[Common Idiosyncratic Quantile Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14267){:target="blank"} (with M.Nevrla)<br/>
preprint draft (May 2023)<br/>

Revise and resubmit, **Review of Finance** <br/>

**Abstract**: We identify a new type of risk that is characterised by commonalities in the quantiles of the cross-sectional distribution of asset returns. Our newly proposed quantile risk factor is associated with a quantile-specific risk premium and provides new insights into how upside and downside risks are priced by investors. In contrast to the previous literature, we recover the common structure in cross-sectional quantiles without making confounding assumptions or aggregating potentially non-linear information. We dis- cuss how the new quantile-based risk factor differs from popular volatility and downside risk factors, and we identify where the quantile-dependent risks deserve greater compensation. Quantile factors also have predictive power for aggregate market returns.  <br/>

[Currency Network Risk](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2101.09738.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Babiak)<br/>
preprint draft (May 2023)<br/>

**Presented at** at 2023 WFA (San Francisco), 2023 SGF Conference (Zurich), 2023 EEA-ESEM (Barcelona) <br/>

**Abstract**: This paper identifies a new currency risk stemming from linkages between option-implied currency volatilities. A volatility network strategy that buys net recipients and sells net transmitters of transitory shocks to ex-ante currency volatilities generates significant excess returns. Net recipients are more exposed to volatility spillovers and compensate investors with higher average returns. In contrast, net transmitters are more resilient to volatility transmissions and offer a lower risk premium because they hedge against volatility interdependencies. When volatility linkages are controlled for contemporaneous correlations, the strategy is uncorrelated with popular benchmarks. The volatility network factor is also priced in a currency cross-section.<br/>

[Learning Probability Distributions in Macroeconomics and Finance](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4083719){:target="blank"} (with L.Hanus)<br/>
preprint draft (Apr 2022)<br/>

**Abstract**: We propose a deep learning approach to probabilistic forecasting of macroeconomic and financial time series. Being able to learn complex patterns from a data rich environment, our approach is useful for a decision making that depends on uncertainty of large number of economic outcomes. Specifically, it is informative to agents facing asymmetric dependence of their loss on outcomes from possibly non-Gaussian and non-linear variables. We show the usefulness of the proposed approach on the two distinct datasets where a machine learns the pattern from data. First, we construct macroeconomic fan charts that reflect information from high-dimensional data set. Second, we illustrate gains in prediction of stock return distributions which are heavy tailed, asymmetric and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio.  <br/>

[Persistence in Economic Networks](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2007.07842.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Ellington)<br/>
preprint draft (Oct 2021)<br/>

Revise and resubmit, **European Journal of Operational Research** <br/>

**Abstract**: This paper studies heterogeneous network structures driven by different degrees of persistence in economic connections. Using frequency domain techniques, we introduce measures that characterize network connections stemming from transitory and persistent components of shocks. Our approach permits testing for statistical differences in such connections that evolve over time. We estimate uncertainty networks from the main US sectors and argue that they track transitory and persistent sources of systemic risk. Hence they may serve as a useful tool for macro-prudential supervisors and investors alike. <br/>

[Dynamic industry uncertainty networks and the business cycle](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2101.06957.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Bevilacqua and R.Faff)<br/>
preprint draft (March 2021)<br/>

Revise and resubmit, **Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control** <br/>

**Abstract**: We argue that uncertainty network structures extracted from option prices contain valuable information for business cycles. Classifying U.S. industries according to their contribution to system-related uncertainty across business cycles, we uncover an uncertainty hub role for the communications, industrials and information technology sectors, while shocks to materials, real estate and utilities do not create strong linkages in the network. Moreover, we find that this ex-ante network of uncertainty is a useful predictor of business cycles, especially when it is based on uncertainty hubs. The industry uncertainty network behaves counter-cyclically in that a tighter network tends to associate with future business cycle contractions. <br/>

[Deep Learning, Predictability, and Optimal Portfolio Returns](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2009.03394.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Babiak)<br/>
preprint draft (July 2021) available<br/>

Revise and resubmit, **Journal of Banking and Finance** <br/>

**Abstract**: We study dynamic portfolio choice of a long-horizon investor who uses deep learning methods to predict equity returns when forming optimal portfolios. Our results show statistically and economically significant benefits from using deep learning to form optimal portfolios through certainty equivalent returns and Sharpe ratios. We demonstrate that a long-short-term-memory recurrent neural network, which excels in learning complex time-series dependencies, generates a superior performance among a variety of networks considered. Return predictability via deep learning generates substantially improved portfolio performance across different subsamples, particularly during recessionary periods. These gains are robust to including transaction costs, short-selling and borrowing constraints. <br/>

[Frequency-Dependent Higher Moment Risks](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3823002){:target="blank"} (with J.Kurka)<br/>
preprint draft (April 2021)<br/>

**Abstract**: Based on intraday data for a large cross-section of individual stocks and exchange traded funds, we show that short-term as well as long-term fluctuations of realized market and average idiosyncratic higher moments risks are priced in the cross-section of asset returns. Specifically, we find that market and average idiosyncratic volatility and kurtosis are significantly priced by investors mainly in the long-run even if controlled by market moments and other factors, while skewness is mostly short-run phenomenon. A conditional pricing model capturing the time-variation of moments confirms downward-sloping term structure of skewness risk and upward-sloping term structure of kurtosis risk, moreover the term structures connected to market skewness risk and average idiosyncratic skewness risk exhibit different dymanics. <br/>

[Co-jumping of Treasury Yield Curve Rates](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1905.01541.html){:target="blank"} (with P.Fiser)<br/>
Submitted (2019)<br/>

**Abstract**: We study the role of co-jumps in the interest rate futures markets. To disentangle continuous part of quadratic covariation from co-jumps, we localize the co-jumps precisely through wavelet coefficients and identify statistically significant ones. Using high frequency data about U.S. and European yield curves we quantify the effect of co-jumps on their correlation structure. Empirical findings reveal much stronger co-jumping behavior of the U.S. yield curves in comparison to the European one. Further, we connect co-jumping behavior to the monetary policy announcements, and study effect of 103 FOMC and 119 ECB announcements on the identified co-jumps during the period from January 2007 to December 2017.

[Dynamic Network Risk](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2006.04639.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Ellington)<br/>
submitted (2020)<br/>

**Abstract**: This paper examines the pricing of short-term and long-term dynamic network risk in the cross-section of stock returns. Stocks with high sensitivities to dynamic network risk earn lower returns. We rationalize our finding with economic theory that allows the stochastic discount factor to load on network risk through the precautionary savings channel. A one-standard deviation increase in long-term (short-term) network risk loadings associate with a 7.66% (6.71%) drop in annualized expected returns.<br/>

[Sentiment-Driven Stochastic Volatility Model: A High-Frequency Textual Tool for Economists](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3397314){:target="blank"} (with Cathy Yi-Hsuan Chen, and J.Vecer)<br/>
Submitted (2019)<br/>

**Abstract**: We propose how to quantify high-frequency market sentiment using high-frequency news from NASDAQ news platform and support vector machine classifiers. News arrive at markets randomly and the resulting news sentiment behaves like a stochastic process. To characterize the joint evolution of sentiment, price, and volatility, we introduce a unified continuous-time sentiment-driven stochastic volatility model. We provide closed-form formulas for moments of the volatility and news sentiment processes and study the news impact. Further, we implement a simulation-based method to calibrate the parameters. Empirically, we document that news sentiment raises the threshold of volatility reversion, sustaining high market volatility.

[Investment Disputes and Abnormal Volatility of Stocks](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3630279){:target="blank"} (with Z.Drabek and M.Nevrla)<br/>
Submitted (2020)<br/>

**Abstract**: Dramatic growth of investment disputes between foreign investors and host states rises serious questions about the impact of those disputes on investors. This paper is the first to explain increased uncertainty of investors about the outcome of arbitration, which may or may not lead to compensation for damages claimed by the investor. We find robust evidence that investment disputes lead to abnormal share fluctuations of companies involved in disputes with host countries. Importantly, while a positive outcome for an investor decreases uncertainty back to original levels, we document strong increase in the volatility of companies with negative outcome for the investor. We find that several variables including size of the award, political instability, location of arbitration, country of origin of investor or public policy considerations in host country explain large portion of the investor's uncertainty.
