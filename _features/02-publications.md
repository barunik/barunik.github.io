[Asymmetric Network Connectedness of Fears](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1810.12022.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Bevilacqua, and R.Tunaru)<br/>
**The Review of Economics and Statistics** (2020) forthcoming<br/>

**Abstract**: This paper introduces forward-looking measures of the network connectedness of fears in the financial system, arising due to the good and bad beliefs of market participants about uncertainty that spreads unequally across a network of banks. We argue that this asymmetric network structure extracted from call and put traded option prices of the main U.S. banks contains valuable information for predicting macroeconomic conditions and economic uncertainty, and it can serve as a tool for forward-looking systemic risk monitoring.

[Deep Learning, Predictability, and Optimal Portfolio Returns](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2009.03394.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Babiak)<br/>
preprint draft (Sept 2020) available<br/>

**Abstract**: We study optimal dynamic portfolio choice of a long-horizon investor who uses deep learning methods to predict equity returns when forming optimal portfolios. The results show statistically and economically significant out-of-sample portfolio benefits of deep learning as measured by high certainty equivalent returns and Sharpe ratios. Return predictability via deep learning generates substantially improved portfolio performance across different subsamples, particularly the recession periods. These gains are robust to including transaction costs, short-selling and borrowing constraints. <br/>

[Dynamic Networks in Large Financial and Economic Systems](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2007.07842.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Ellington)<br/>
submitted (2020)<br/>

**Abstract**: We propose new measures to characterize dynamic network connections in large financial and economic systems. In doing so, our measures allow one to describe and understand causal network structures that evolve throughout time and over horizons using variance decomposition matrices from time-varying parameter VAR (TVP VAR) models. These methods allow researchers and practitioners to examine network connections over any horizon of interest whilst also being applicable to a wide range of economic and financial data. Our empirical application redefines the meaning of big in big data, in the context of TVP VAR models, and track dynamic connections among illiquidity ratios of all S\&P500 constituents. We then study the information content of these measures for the market return and real economy. <br/>

[Dynamic Network Risk](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2006.04639.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Ellington)<br/>
submitted (2020)<br/>

**Abstract**: This paper examines the pricing of short-term and long-term dynamic network risk in the cross-section of stock returns. Stocks with high sensitivities to dynamic network risk earn lower returns. We rationalize our finding with economic theory that allows the stochastic discount factor to load on network risk through the precautionary savings channel. A one-standard deviation increase in long-term (short-term) network risk loadings associate with a 7.66% (6.71%) drop in annualized expected returns.<br/>

[Sentiment-Driven Stochastic Volatility Model: A High-Frequency Textual Tool for Economists](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3397314){:target="blank"} (with Cathy Yi-Hsuan Chen, and J.Vecer)<br/>
Submitted (2019)<br/>

**Abstract**: We propose how to quantify high-frequency market sentiment using high-frequency news from NASDAQ news platform and support vector machine classifiers. News arrive at markets randomly and the resulting news sentiment behaves like a stochastic process. To characterize the joint evolution of sentiment, price, and volatility, we introduce a unified continuous-time sentiment-driven stochastic volatility model. We provide closed-form formulas for moments of the volatility and news sentiment processes and study the news impact. Further, we implement a simulation-based method to calibrate the parameters. Empirically, we document that news sentiment raises the threshold of volatility reversion, sustaining high market volatility.

[Quantile Spectral Beta: A Tale of Tail Risks, Investment Horizons, and Asset Prices](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1806.06148.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Nevrla)<br/>
Submitted (2020)<br/>

**Abstract**: We examine how extreme market risks are priced in the cross-section of asset returns at various horizons. Based on the decomposition of covariance between indicator functions capturing fluctuations of different parts of return distributions over various frequencies, we define a quantile spectral beta representation that characterizes asset's risk generally. Nesting the traditional frameworks, the new representation explains tail-specific as well as horizon-, or frequency-specific spectral risks. Further, we work with two notions of frequency-specific extreme market risks. First, we define tail market risk that captures dependence between extremely low market and asset returns. Second, extreme market volatility risk is characterized by dependence between extremely high increments of market volatility and extremely low asset return. Empirical findings based on the datasets with long enough history, 30 Fama-French Industry portfolios, and 25 Fama-French portfolios sorted on size and book-to-market support our intuition. We reach the same conclusion using stock-level data as well as daily data. These results suggest that both frequency-specific tail market risk and extreme volatility risk are priced and our final model provides significant improvement over specifications considered by previous literature.

[Co-jumping of Treasury Yield Curve Rates](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1905.01541.html){:target="blank"} (with P.Fiser)<br/>
Submitted (2019)<br/>

**Abstract**: We study the role of co-jumps in the interest rate futures markets. To disentangle continuous part of quadratic covariation from co-jumps, we localize the co-jumps precisely through wavelet coefficients and identify statistically significant ones. Using high frequency data about U.S. and European yield curves we quantify the effect of co-jumps on their correlation structure. Empirical findings reveal much stronger co-jumping behavior of the U.S. yield curves in comparison to the European one. Further, we connect co-jumping behavior to the monetary policy announcements, and study effect of 103 FOMC and 119 ECB announcements on the identified co-jumps during the period from January 2007 to December 2017.

[Investment Disputes and Abnormal Volatility of Stocks](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3630279){:target="blank"} (with Z.Drabek and M.Nevrla)<br/>
Submitted (2020)<br/>

**Abstract**: Dramatic growth of investment disputes between foreign investors and host states rises serious questions about the impact of those disputes on investors. This paper is the first to explain increased uncertainty of investors about the outcome of arbitration, which may or may not lead to compensation for damages claimed by the investor. We find robust evidence that investment disputes lead to abnormal share fluctuations of companies involved in disputes with host countries. Importantly, while a positive outcome for an investor decreases uncertainty back to original levels, we document strong increase in the volatility of companies with negative outcome for the investor. We find that several variables including size of the award, political instability, location of arbitration, country of origin of investor or public policy considerations in host country explain large portion of the investor's uncertainty.
