["Who's the Boss?"" The Role of Shareholders in Banks' Lending Decisions](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4972832){:target="blank"} (with P.Katsoulis, E.Gerba and J.A. Smith)<br/>
preprint draft (Oct 2024)<br/>

**Abstract**: We investigate banks' lending decisions in the face of shareholder pressure to make payouts. We exploit the regulatory ban on banks' distributions during the Covid-19 pandemic to show that the conflict between the interests of banks' shareholders and their borrowers can persist even with such a ban. First, we find that restricted banks faced an increase in shareholders' required rate of return, which was even higher for the banks most exposed to income-oriented investors. This led to an increase in the required rate of return on their overall capital. Second, banks responded by increasing lending volumes only to medium-sized and larger firms and on smaller loans, which are less capital intensive. However, they utilised government guarantee schemes to increase lending volumes to smaller firms and on larger loans. The results suggest that distribution restrictions can incentivise banks to increase lending, but in a way that minimises the capital impact to appease shareholders.

[The Common Factor in Volatility Risk Premia](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4618943){:target="blank"} (with M.Babiak, M.Ellington, and M.Bevilacqua)<br/>
preprint draft (Feb 2024)<br/>

**Abstract**: We show that firm-level volatility risk premium obeys a strong factor structure. Such factor structure is also present in a decomposition of firms’ volatility risk premium into good and bad counterparts, capturing compensation for realized volatility in positive and negative returns. Stocks with the weakest exposures to the common bad volatility risk premium factor earn average returns 7.32% higher than those with the strongest exposures. The common factor in total (bad) volatility risk premium predicts stock market returns at all horizons up to 24 months (from 6 months) both in-sample and out-of-sample. This predictive power is incremental to existing predictors.

[Volatility Shocks and Currency Returns](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2101.09738.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Babiak)<br/>
preprint draft (July 2025)<br/>

**Presented at** at 2023 WFA (San Francisco), 2023 SGF Conference (Zurich), 2023 EEA-ESEM (Barcelona) <br/>

**Abstract**: This paper examines how shocks to currency volatilities predict exchange rates. Theoretically, we develop a multi-country model where jumps in one country can influence others. We demonstrate that a currency’s expected excess return and volatility depend on the jump effects across all countries. Empirically, we document a negative cross-sectional association between the currency premia and transmitted volatility shocks to others, consistent with the theory. Buying the weakest and selling the strongest transmitters of strongly correlated volatility shocks resembles the carry trade. In contrast, a strategy based on volatility shocks that control for common correlation reflects a novel source of predictability.<br/>
