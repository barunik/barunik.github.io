[Quantile Preferences in Portfolio Choice: A Q-DRL 1 Approach to Dynamic Diversification](https://ideas.repec.org/p/fau/wpaper/wp2024_21.html){:target="blank"} (with A.Sarkany and L.Janasek) (May 2024)<br/>

**Abstract**: We develop a novel approach to understand the dynamic diversification of decision makers with quantile preferences. Due to unavailability of analytical solutions to such complex problems, we suggest to approximate the behavior of agents with a Quantile Deep Reinforcement Learning (Q-DRL) algorithm. The research will provide a new level of understanding the behavior of economic agents with respect to preferences, captured by quantiles, without assuming a specific utility function or distribution of returns. Furthermore, we are challenging the traditional diversification methods as they proved to be insufficient due to heightened correlations and similar risk features between asset classes, and rather the research delves into risk factor investing as a solution and portfolio optimization based on them.

[Forecasting Volatility of Oil-based Commodities: The Model of Dynamic Persistence](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2402.01354.html){:target="blank"} (with L.Vacha) preprint draft (February 2024)<br/>

**Abstract**: Time variation and persistence are crucial properties of volatility that are often studied separately in oil-based volatility forecasting models. Here, we propose a novel approach that allows shocks with heterogeneous persistence to vary smoothly over time, and thus model the two together. We argue that this is important because such dynamics arise naturally from the dynamic nature of shocks in oil-based commodities. We identify such dynamics from the data using localised regressions and build a model that significantly improves volatility forecasts. Such forecasting models, based on a rich persistence structure that varies smoothly over time, outperform state-of-the-art benchmark models and are particularly useful for forecasting over longer horizons.

[Moderation or indulgence? Effects of bank distribution restrictions during stress](https://ideas.repec.org/p/boe/boeewp/1053.html){:target="blank"} (with J.A. Smith, E.Gerba and P.Katsoulis)<br/>
**Bank of England** Staff Working Paper No. 1 053 (Nov 2023)<br/>

**Abstract**: At the onset of the Covid‑19 crisis, several regulatory authorities issued a recommendation or request to banks to restrict their dividend and share buyback distributions. The purpose of this action was to increase banks’ resilience by not distributing retained earnings, and help them support the real economy given their unique role in doing so. These restrictions reflected the singular circumstances brought by Covid‑19. We evaluate the impact of these restrictions on banks’ resilience, lending and investors’ required rate of return. First, using a difference‑in‑differences analysis on an international sample of European banks, we find that restricted banks increased their available Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital and resilience in every quarter while the restrictions were fully in place, before gradually reducing it once they were partly lifted. Second, using a data set on the universe of UK small and medium‑sized enterprise (SME) loans issued by nine UK banking groups, we find that restricted banks increased their lending volumes on smaller non‑government guaranteed loans throughout the implementation period. Third, using the international sample of European banks, we find that the restrictions increased shareholders’ required rate of return throughout the implementation period, with the impact on the required rate of return on capital partially offset by lower debtholders’ required rate of return. The results indicate that distribution restrictions can be an effective crisis tool to increase banks’ resilience and lending capacity.

[Common Firm-level Investor Fears: Evidence from Equity Options](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2309.03968.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Bevilacqua and M.Ellington)<br/>
preprint draft (Sept 2023)<br/>

**Abstract**: We identify a new type of risk, common firm-level investor fears, from commonalities within the cross-sectional distribution of individual stock options. We define firm-level fears that link with upward price movements as good fears, and those relating to downward price movements as bad fears.  Such information is different to market fears that we extract from index options. Stocks with high sensitivities to common firm-level investor fears earn lower returns, with investors demanding a higher compensation for exposure to common bad fears relative to common good fears. Risk premium estimates for common bad fears range from -5.63% to -4.92% per annum.

[Learning Probability Distributions of Day-Ahead Electricity Prices](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2310.02867.html){:target="blank"} (with L.Hanus)<br/>
preprint draft (Oct 2023)<br/>

**Abstract**: We propose a novel machine learning approach to probabilistic forecasting of hourly day-ahead electricity prices. In contrast to recent advances in data-rich probabilistic forecasting that approximate the distributions with some features such as moments, our method is non-parametric and selects the best distribution from all possible empirical distributions learned from the data. The model we propose is a multiple output neural network with a monotonicity adjusting penalty. Such a distributional neural network can learn complex patterns in electricity prices from data-rich environments and it outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.<br/>

[Currency Network Risk](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2101.09738.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Babiak)<br/>
preprint draft (May 2023)<br/>

**Presented at** at 2023 WFA (San Francisco), 2023 SGF Conference (Zurich), 2023 EEA-ESEM (Barcelona) <br/>

**Abstract**: This paper identifies a new currency risk stemming from linkages between option-implied currency volatilities. A volatility network strategy that buys net recipients and sells net transmitters of transitory shocks to ex-ante currency volatilities generates significant excess returns. Net recipients are more exposed to volatility spillovers and compensate investors with higher average returns. In contrast, net transmitters are more resilient to volatility transmissions and offer a lower risk premium because they hedge against volatility interdependencies. When volatility linkages are controlled for contemporaneous correlations, the strategy is uncorrelated with popular benchmarks. The volatility network factor is also priced in a currency cross-section.<br/>

[Learning Probability Distributions in Macroeconomics and Finance](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2204.06848.html){:target="blank"} (with L.Hanus)<br/>
preprint draft (Apr 2022)<br/>

**Abstract**: We propose a deep learning approach to probabilistic forecasting of macroeconomic and financial time series. Being able to learn complex patterns from a data rich environment, our approach is useful for a decision making that depends on uncertainty of large number of economic outcomes. Specifically, it is informative to agents facing asymmetric dependence of their loss on outcomes from possibly non-Gaussian and non-linear variables. We show the usefulness of the proposed approach on the two distinct datasets where a machine learns the pattern from data. First, we construct macroeconomic fan charts that reflect information from high-dimensional data set. Second, we illustrate gains in prediction of stock return distributions which are heavy tailed, asymmetric and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio.  <br/>

[Risks of heterogeneously persistent higher moments](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2104.04264.html){:target="blank"} (with J.Kurka)<br/>
preprint draft (March 2024)<br/>

**Abstract**: Using intraday data for the cross-section of individual stocks, we show that both transitory and persistent fluctuations in realized market and average idiosyncratic volatility, skewness and kurtosis are differentially priced in the cross-section of asset returns, implying a heterogeneous persistence structure of different sources of higher moment risks. Specifically, we find that idiosyncratic transitory shocks to volatility as well as idiosyncratic persistent shocks to skewness contain strong commonalities that are relevant to investors. <br/>
