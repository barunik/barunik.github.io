[Quantile Preferences in Portfolio Choice: A Q-DRL 1 Approach to Dynamic Diversification](https://ideas.repec.org/p/fau/wpaper/wp2024_21.html){:target="blank"} (with A.Sarkany and L.Janasek) (May 2024)<br/>

**Abstract**: We develop a novel approach to understand the dynamic diversification of decision makers with quantile preferences. Due to unavailability of analytical solutions to such complex problems, we suggest to approximate the behavior of agents with a Quantile Deep Reinforcement Learning (Q-DRL) algorithm. The research will provide a new level of understanding the behavior of economic agents with respect to preferences, captured by quantiles, without assuming a specific utility function or distribution of returns. Furthermore, we are challenging the traditional diversification methods as they proved to be insufficient due to heightened correlations and similar risk features between asset classes, and rather the research delves into risk factor investing as a solution and portfolio optimization based on them.

["Who's the Boss?"" The Role of Shareholders in Banks' Lending Decisions](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4972832){:target="blank"} (with P.Katsoulis, E.Gerba and J.A. Smith)<br/>
preprint draft (Oct 2024)<br/>

**Abstract**: We investigate banks' lending decisions in the face of shareholder pressure to make payouts. We exploit the regulatory ban on banks' distributions during the Covid-19 pandemic to show that the conflict between the interests of banks' shareholders and their borrowers can persist even with such a ban. First, we find that restricted banks faced an increase in shareholders' required rate of return, which was even higher for the banks most exposed to income-oriented investors. This led to an increase in the required rate of return on their overall capital. Second, banks responded by increasing lending volumes only to medium-sized and larger firms and on smaller loans, which are less capital intensive. However, they utilised government guarantee schemes to increase lending volumes to smaller firms and on larger loans. The results suggest that distribution restrictions can incentivise banks to increase lending, but in a way that minimises the capital impact to appease shareholders.

[Common Firm-level Investor Fears: Evidence from Equity Options](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2309.03968.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Bevilacqua and M.Ellington)<br/>
preprint draft (Sept 2023)<br/>

**Abstract**: We identify a new type of risk, common firm-level investor fears, from commonalities within the cross-sectional distribution of individual stock options. We define firm-level fears that link with upward price movements as good fears, and those relating to downward price movements as bad fears.  Such information is different to market fears that we extract from index options. Stocks with high sensitivities to common firm-level investor fears earn lower returns, with investors demanding a higher compensation for exposure to common bad fears relative to common good fears. Risk premium estimates for common bad fears range from -5.63% to -4.92% per annum.

[Currency Network Risk](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2101.09738.html){:target="blank"} (with M.Babiak)<br/>
preprint draft (May 2023)<br/>

**Presented at** at 2023 WFA (San Francisco), 2023 SGF Conference (Zurich), 2023 EEA-ESEM (Barcelona) <br/>

**Abstract**: This paper identifies a new currency risk stemming from linkages between option-implied currency volatilities. A volatility network strategy that buys net recipients and sells net transmitters of transitory shocks to ex-ante currency volatilities generates significant excess returns. Net recipients are more exposed to volatility spillovers and compensate investors with higher average returns. In contrast, net transmitters are more resilient to volatility transmissions and offer a lower risk premium because they hedge against volatility interdependencies. When volatility linkages are controlled for contemporaneous correlations, the strategy is uncorrelated with popular benchmarks. The volatility network factor is also priced in a currency cross-section.<br/>
